</p><h3>Wednesday, September 17, 2025, Prince Georges Room, University of Maryland:</h3>
</p><h3>Presenter: Dr. Holly Brewer</h3>

<p></p>

<p>
First Dr. Brewer explained the motivation for creating the Bill of Rights in the first place. 
She explained that after the failure of the first government in the new country, the Articles of Confederation, there was a desire by the Federalists to create a more powerful federal government.
The Antifederalists were worried that this new government would quickly become as tyrannical and oppressive as the British King was. 
These concerns fueled the Antifederalists to draft the Bill of Rights as a way of ensuring personal freedoms under this new more powerful federal system. 
After explaining the motivation for the Bill of Rights Dr. Brewer explained each of the amendments in the Bill of Rights and discussed the founding ideas that they were based on. 
Each amendment matched relatively closely to a grievance in the Declaration of Independence and provided the rights for the people to not be oppressed by the new government in the same way King George did. 
This Bill of Rights established the government as a body specifically designed to help people and provide them these rights when other governments would instead oppress them. 
For instance the first amendment provided protection against government restriction of free speech and oppression. 
This explicit protection of their rights was radically different from the oppression under King George and comforted the people that their rights would be preserved even with increased federal power. 
After providing the historical context for the Bill of Rights Dr. Brewer went on to provide information about how the Bill of Rights can be applied in our current political situation. 
She explained how in recent times a certain political party has challenged some of these personal freedoms and began to threaten the rights promised to the people by these amendments. 
For instance, recently Trump has used the FCC to threaten and silence talk show hosts like Jimmy Kimmel and others, even going so far as to force them off the air. 
Dr. Brewer provided an empowering message that this Bill of Rights still very much applies today and that this document still stands strong as a paragon of individual rights in the face of government tyranny. 
She suggested that we should stand up for our rights in an age of authoritarianism and continue to fervently protect our rights guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights.
