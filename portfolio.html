Hi I'm Alex, a Computer Engineering major at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm also a member of the College Park Scholars program Science and Global Change, a volunteering and service based learning organization. 
I also am a member of the IEEE student chapter at UMD and a member of the Terps Racing EV team.
I enjoy designing and programing computer and robotics systems and I plan to persue a career as an engineer designing computer components, power systems, and software systems.
I intend to either persue a double major in EE and CE or a BS/MS in CE while hopefully participating in undergraduate research at any number of UMD's computer engineering labs.
Curently I am working on a number of projects such as my ENES 100 OTV (Over Terrain Vehicle) and the BSPD (Braking System Plausibility Device).
Outside of academics I love going to the gym, watching baseball, reading, writing software, and finally going to UMD Soccer games.

On this site, you'll find links to activities associated with SGC as I post them throughout the next 2 years as well as my contact information and some other important links including a previous research paper!
